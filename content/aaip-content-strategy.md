# AAIP Content Strategy & Voice Guide

## 1. Party Voice & Tone Guide

### Core Identity

**Not left. Not right. Empirical.**

The AAIP communicates like someone who's actually run a business, paid taxes, and dealt with the real world — because that's who we are. We're the party for people who are sick of ideology masquerading as policy.

### Voice Principles

**Direct Australian.** Say it plain. No political weasel words. If the answer is complicated, explain the complication — don't hide behind buzzwords like "responsible innovation" or "ensuring no one is left behind." Those phrases mean nothing and everyone knows it.

**Evidence over ideology.** Every claim has a source. Every policy has modelling. When we say something, we show our working. If the Grattan Institute, the Productivity Commission, or the RBA agrees with us, we say so. If the evidence is contested, we say that too.

**Never dodge hard questions.** If someone asks "Will you ban negative gearing?" we don't say "We'll consult with stakeholders." We say: "The evidence from every serious economist says negative gearing inflates house prices and transfers wealth from young to old. Here's what we'd do and here's the modelling." If we don't know yet, we say "We don't know yet — here's what we're figuring out."

**Acknowledge uncertainty honestly.** We don't pretend to have all the answers. AI governance is genuinely new territory. Some of our ideas will be wrong. We'll say so when we find out, and we'll adjust. That's not weakness — that's the scientific method applied to politics.

**Anti-ideology, pro-evidence.** We take the legitimate concerns of One Nation voters seriously without the xenophobia. We share the Greens' urgency on climate without the economic illiteracy. We believe in markets like the Liberals used to, and in fairness like Labor used to.

**Respect the audience.** Never talk down. Never condescend. Treat voters like adults who can handle complexity. The Henry Tax Review had 138 recommendations — if we can't explain why they matter in plain language, that's our failure, not the voters'.

### What We Sound Like

- "The numbers don't work, and everybody who's done the maths knows the numbers don't work."
- "This isn't fatalism. It's realism."
- "Career politicians would hate this. Which tells you everything you need to know about whether it's a good idea."
- "Not a vague 'future of work' report full of consultant waffle."
- "Paying people to exist isn't compassion — it's surrender."

### What We Never Sound Like

- "We're committed to ensuring equitable outcomes through multi-stakeholder engagement..."
- "Both sides have valid points..."  (unless both sides literally do)
- "We need to have a conversation about..."  (conversations are what you have instead of action)
- Anything that could come from any party's press release

### Formatting & Platform Rules

- **Long-form (website, blog):** Evidence-heavy. Link sources. Use data tables. Show the modelling. This is where the depth lives.
- **Social media:** Lead with the sharpest line. One idea per post. Memes welcome — but they need to be actually funny, not "how do you do fellow kids."
- **Video:** Paul's voice. Straight to camera. No teleprompter feel. Speak like you're explaining it to a smart mate over a beer.
- **WhatsApp/Discord:** No markdown tables. Bold or CAPS for emphasis. Keep it punchy.

### Handling Attacks

| Attack | Response Style |
|--------|---------------|
| "You're just tech bros" | Acknowledge the perception. Show our actual candidate base. Point to housing, tax, workforce policies. |
| "AI is dangerous" | Agree it can be. That's why we want people who understand it making the rules, not people who can't tell ML from a spreadsheet macro. |
| "You're too small to matter" | The teals were too small to matter until they won six seats. The crossbench is where Australian politics is heading. |
| "What's your position on X?" | Give an honest answer. If we haven't formed one yet, say so and explain how we'd approach it (evidence-first). |

## 2. Gen Z Strategy

### Who They Are

Gen Z (born ~1997–2012, now 14–29) are the most politically disengaged and simultaneously most politically anxious generation in Australian history. They don't trust institutions, but they also don't trust populists. They're looking for authenticity and they can smell bullshit from a postcode away.

### What the Research Tells Us

**Grattan Institute — "Generation Gap" (2019, updated findings):**
- Young Australians are the first generation in memory at risk of lower living standards than their parents
- Household wealth for under-35s has barely moved since 2004, while over-65 household wealth grew 50%+
- The "avocado toast" narrative is a myth — young people spend *less* on non-essentials and *more* on housing than 30 years ago
- Fewer working-age people per retiree: 7.4 in the 1970s → 4.4 in 2015 → projected 3.2 by 2055
- Government policy (super tax concessions, negative gearing, CGT discount) has actively widened the generational gap

**ABS Data (2025):**
- Mean dwelling price nationally: $1,045,400 (Sep 2025)
- NSW mean: $1,295,900
- QLD mean: $1,005,600
- Total residential dwelling value: $11.93 trillion
- Home ownership among under-35s has fallen dramatically across all birth cohorts compared to their parents at the same age

**Australian Political Context:**
- Gen Z saw the Voice referendum fail — they're sceptical of symbolic gestures
- They've watched housing become unattainable in real time while politicians do nothing
- They're the first generation where AI is normalised — they use ChatGPT for study, not existential dread
- Climate matters but pragmatically — they want solutions, not protests
- Cost of living crisis hits them hardest: rent, groceries, HECS debt, stagnant entry wages

### Their #1 Issues (Ranked)

1. **Housing affordability** — They're locked out entirely. Not "it's hard to buy." Literally impossible for most without parental wealth.
2. **Cost of living** — Rent, groceries, utilities. They're not building wealth, they're surviving.
3. **Climate** — But pragmatic climate. They want a transition plan, not a placard.
4. **Mental health** — Anxiety, depression rates are skyrocketing. They connect this to economic precarity.
5. **Job security / AI displacement** — They're not scared of AI itself, but they're anxious about what it means for their career.
6. **Education debt** — HECS indexation hit them hard. They feel the system extracted value while delivering diminishing returns.

### How AAIP Reaches Gen Z

**Platform Strategy:**

| Platform | Content Type | Frequency | Tone |
|----------|-------------|-----------|------|
| TikTok | 30-90 sec sharp takes, explainers, "did you know" facts | Daily | Direct, slightly angry, data-backed |
| YouTube | 5-15 min deep dives, policy explainers | 2x/week | Thoughtful, evidence-heavy, respectful |
| Instagram | Carousels (data visualisations), Reels (short takes) | Daily | Visual, shareable, provocative stats |
| Reddit | r/AustralianPolitics, r/australia AMAs | Monthly | Long-form, evidence-heavy, engage in comments |
| Discord | Community server, policy discussion channels | Always-on | Raw, unfiltered, community-driven |

**Content Pillars for Gen Z:**

1. **"Show Your Working"** — Every policy claim comes with the data. Link the Grattan report. Show the ABS numbers. Let them verify. This generation fact-checks everything.

2. **"The System Is Rigged (And Here's the Spreadsheet)"** — Not conspiracy theory. Literal policy mechanics. Negative gearing costs $10.9 billion/year. The median house-to-income ratio is 12:1+ in Sydney. Show the receipts.

3. **"AI Isn't the Problem, These Clowns Are"** — Gen Z doesn't fear AI. They fear the people making AI policy who don't understand it. Position AAIP as the adults in the room on tech.

4. **"Your Parents Got Free Uni AND Cheap Houses"** — Intergenerational equity framed with data, not whinging. Boomers aren't the enemy — the policy settings are.

5. **"The Only Party That Admits What It Doesn't Know"** — Radical transparency is the differentiator. No other party says "we don't know yet but here's how we'd find out."

**What NOT to Do:**

- ❌ Don't use Gen Z slang you don't naturally use. They'll roast you.
- ❌ Don't make "fellow kids" memes. If you need to ask if a meme is cringe, it's cringe.
- ❌ Don't patronise. "Young people need to understand..." — no. They understand fine. The system failed them.
- ❌ Don't promise utopia. They've been lied to their whole lives. Honest pessimism + a plan beats fake optimism.
- ❌ Don't ignore their platforms. If you're not on TikTok, you don't exist.

**What TO Do:**

- ✅ Let actual young members create content. Give them the data, let them make the TikToks.
- ✅ Respond to comments. Engage in threads. Be a person, not a brand.
- ✅ Admit mistakes publicly and quickly. This builds trust faster than anything.
- ✅ Use humour — but make it actually funny. Dry, dark, Australian.
- ✅ Collaborate with creators who already have trust (without making it feel like a sponsorship).

### Key Messages for Gen Z

> "You're not bad with money. The system is bad at fairness. Here's the data."

> "We're the party that actually understands the tech that's reshaping your career. Because we've built it."

> "Every other party tells you what you want to hear. We'll tell you what's actually happening — and what we'd do about it."

> "Housing isn't a market failure. It's a policy choice. Here are the policies, and here's who benefits from not changing them."

## 3. Housing Affordability — AI Evidence-Based Policy Framework

### The Problem (Honestly Stated)

Australia's housing market is broken. Not "challenging" or "tight" — broken.

**The numbers (2025):**
- National mean dwelling price: **$1,045,400** (ABS, Sep 2025)
- Sydney mean: **$1,295,900**
- Median house price-to-income ratio: **~12:1 in Sydney, ~9:1 nationally** (historically, 3-4:1 was considered affordable)
- Total residential dwelling stock value: **$11.93 trillion** — larger than Australia's entire superannuation pool
- Negative gearing cost to budget: **$10.9 billion/year** in foregone tax (projected $12.3B for 2024-25)
- Social housing waitlists: **~175,000 households** nationally, with wait times of 2-10+ years depending on jurisdiction
- Home ownership rate for under-35s: fallen dramatically since the early 2000s; wealth for this cohort has barely moved since 2004 (Grattan Institute)

The median house price has roughly tripled in Sydney since 2003, when the Reserve Bank first warned that resources were being "disproportionately channelled into" property investment.

**The intergenerational injustice:** Boomers got free university education AND affordable houses. Their median house-to-income ratio at peak earning age was approximately 3-4:1. Gen Z gets HECS debt AND a 12:1 ratio. This isn't whinging — it's a structural transfer of wealth from young to old, facilitated by deliberate policy choices (negative gearing, CGT discount, restricted supply, inadequate social housing investment).

### AAIP Policy Framework

#### A. Supply Side — Planning Reform with AI

**The problem:** Australia's planning systems are slow, opaque, and captured by NIMBYism. Development approvals take months to years. Zoning decisions are made politically, not analytically.

**AI-enabled solutions:**

1. **AI-optimised zoning modelling.** Before any zoning change, run transparent simulation models that show: traffic impact, infrastructure demand, school capacity, healthcare access, environmental effects, property value changes. Publish the models. Let anyone run scenarios. Replace "community consultation" theatre with actual data-driven engagement.

2. **Fast-track approvals via AI assessment.** For developments that comply with local plans, AI can assess applications in days, not months. Flag genuine issues for human review. Rubber-stamp the compliant ones. The NSW planning system processes ~100,000 DAs per year — most are straightforward and don't need 6 months of human review.

3. **Infrastructure-linked rezoning.** AI models that identify where increased density is viable based on existing/planned infrastructure — transport, water, power, schools. Rezone proactively where infrastructure supports it, rather than reactively after political pressure.

4. **Anti-NIMBY data transparency.** When residents oppose development, publish the modelled impacts. "This 50-unit apartment building will add 23 cars to peak-hour traffic on Smith Street, increase local school enrolment by 12 students (within capacity), and reduce the median commute for residents by 8 minutes." Data kills vibes-based opposition.

#### B. Demand Side — Tax Reform (With Modelling, Not Ideology)

**Negative gearing reform:**
- The Deloitte Access Economics modelling shows reforming negative gearing and the CGT discount would reduce property prices by ~4.6% nationally (8.3% in Sydney/Melbourne) and reduce rents by 0.5%
- AAIP position: Grandfather existing arrangements (no retrospective changes), but limit negative gearing on new investments to new housing construction only. This shifts the tax subsidy from bidding up existing housing to building new supply.
- Publish the full distributional modelling. Show who gains, who loses, by income quintile, by age, by geography.

**CGT discount reform:**
- Replace the flat 50% discount with inflation indexation (the pre-1999 Howard system). This is more economically rational — you're taxing real gains, not nominal ones — and it removes the arbitrage that makes property speculation more attractive than productive investment.

**First home buyer grants — honestly assessed:**
- The evidence consistently shows demand-side subsidies (grants, stamp duty concessions) inflate prices by roughly the amount of the subsidy. They help individual buyers in the short term while making the aggregate problem worse. AAIP would publish this evidence honestly rather than promising bigger grants at election time.

#### C. Foreign Investment — Data-Driven, Not Xenophobic

- Foreign buyers account for a small percentage of total purchases (~4-8% depending on the year and data source). They are not the primary driver of unaffordability.
- Enforce existing rules properly. The FIRB framework is adequate; enforcement has been weak.
- AI-powered monitoring of property transactions to flag potential foreign ownership rule breaches. Transparent reporting of actual foreign purchase volumes by suburb and price bracket.
- Don't scapegoat. The data shows domestic policy settings (negative gearing, CGT discount, supply restrictions) are overwhelmingly more impactful than foreign investment. Say so honestly, even though "blame foreigners" polls well.

#### D. Social Housing — Massive Investment with AI Optimisation

**The deficit:** Australia has approximately 430,000 social housing dwellings serving ~800,000 tenants. Waitlists are ~175,000 households. The deficit is estimated at 500,000+ dwellings and growing.

**AAIP approach:**
- Commit to a national social housing construction target (the Grattan Institute recommends 25,000 new social housing dwellings per year for a decade)
- Fund it honestly: this costs real money (~$10-12B/year). The budget savings from negative gearing reform partially offset this.
- **AI for optimal allocation:** Match tenants to available housing based on need, location of employment/family, accessibility requirements. Currently, allocation is often geographic lottery. AI can optimise for outcomes.
- **AI for predictive maintenance:** Model maintenance needs across the housing stock. Fix things before they break. The current social housing stock is deteriorating because maintenance is reactive and underfunded.
- **AI for site selection:** Model optimal locations for new social housing based on transport access, employment centres, school capacity, and community integration. Avoid concentrating disadvantage.

#### E. Rent Regulation — International Evidence

**What the evidence says:**

The international evidence on rent control is nuanced — neither "always bad" nor "always good":

- **Strict rent freezes** (e.g., old-style New York, Berlin's Mietendeckel): Strong consensus they reduce supply, deteriorate housing quality, and create insider-outsider dynamics. Berlin's rent cap was struck down by courts in 2021 after evidence of reduced new construction.
- **Moderate rent stabilisation** (e.g., Germany's Mietpreisbremse, Ireland's Rent Pressure Zones): Limits on annual rent increases (e.g., CPI + 2%) show more mixed results. They can slow rent growth without the worst supply effects, but only if combined with supply-side measures.
- **Tenancy protections** (e.g., longer default leases, limits on no-grounds evictions): Strong evidence these improve tenant welfare with minimal supply impact. Germany's indefinite default tenancy is a model.

**AAIP position:**
- No to rent freezes. The evidence is clear they make things worse.
- Yes to moderate rent stabilisation linked to CPI, as a transitional measure while supply catches up. With a sunset clause.
- Yes to stronger tenancy protections: minimum lease terms, limits on no-grounds evictions, portable bonds.
- AI for rent transparency: publish real-time rent data by suburb, dwelling type, and quality. Information asymmetry favours landlords. Fix that.

#### F. Behavioural Economics — Change the Incentives

**Why people speculate on housing:** It's rational. Given the current tax settings (negative gearing + CGT discount + leveraged capital gains + no broad-based land tax), property speculation offers better risk-adjusted returns than almost any other investment available to ordinary Australians. People aren't greedy — they're responding to incentives.

**AAIP approach:** Change the incentives, change the behaviour.
- Reform negative gearing and CGT discount (as above) to reduce the tax advantage of property speculation
- Introduce a broad-based land tax to replace stamp duty (as the Henry Review recommended). This shifts the cost from transaction to holding, discouraging land banking and encouraging productive use.
- Make alternative investments more accessible and attractive. Super contribution limits, share investment tax treatment, small business investment incentives.

#### G. What AI Specifically Enables

Beyond the specific applications above, AI transforms housing policy by making it **transparent and auditable**:

1. **Open-source policy modelling.** Publish the models. Let anyone run "what if" scenarios. "What happens to Sydney median prices if we reform negative gearing and increase density along the Metro West corridor?" Anyone can check.

2. **Real-time impact tracking.** Once policies are implemented, AI monitors outcomes in real time. Are prices responding as modelled? Is supply increasing? Where are the unexpected effects? Adjust based on data, not ideology.

3. **Removing politics from allocation.** Infrastructure spending, social housing placement, planning approvals — all can be data-driven rather than politically driven. No more colour-coded spreadsheets in ministers' offices.

4. **Predicting demand.** AI models that forecast housing demand by location, dwelling type, and price point — enabling proactive planning rather than reactive crisis management.

5. **Intergenerational equity dashboards.** Publicly visible, real-time tracking of the wealth gap between generations, home ownership rates by age cohort, and the distributional impact of current policy settings. Make the structural injustice visible and measurable.

### The Honest Caveat

Housing affordability won't be fixed quickly. Anyone who promises a quick fix is lying. The distortions have built up over decades and unwinding them takes time. Prices won't halve overnight — nor should they, because millions of Australians have their life savings in their homes and a price crash would be devastating.

The goal is to bend the curve: slow price growth, increase supply, shift incentives away from speculation toward productive investment, and ensure the next generation has a realistic path to home ownership — or at least secure, affordable rental.

This requires political courage that career politicians have repeatedly demonstrated they don't have. It's one of the strongest arguments for citizen legislators who have careers to go back to and can afford to make unpopular decisions.
