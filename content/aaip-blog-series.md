# AAIP Blog Post Series Plan

Derived from *The Death of the Citizen Politician* manifesto (~13,000 words). Each post is designed to stand alone at 1,500–2,000 words while linking back to the full manifesto.

## Post 1: "Where Did All the Farmers Go?"
**Subtitle:** The death of the citizen politician and why your parliament looks nothing like your country

**Key Argument:** Australia's best policy era (1983–2000) was driven by politicians who'd actually done things — farmed, doctored, built businesses. Today's parliament is a monoculture of career politicians, and the policy drought proves it.

**Draws From:** Opening sections (Hawke cabinet, Peter Walsh, Neal Blewett), The Howard Exception, The People We're Not Representing

**Gen Z Hook:** "Your grandparents' politicians had actual jobs. Yours have LinkedIn profiles full of 'political advisor' and 'staffer.' Guess which era produced better policy?"

**Social Media Angle:** Side-by-side graphic: 1983 Hawke cabinet backgrounds (farmer, cop, teacher, solicitor) vs. 2024 cabinet backgrounds (staffer, staffer, union organiser, staffer). TikTok: "POV: You're looking for someone in parliament who's ever met a payroll."

## Post 2: "The Pipeline"
**Subtitle:** How university → staffer → safe seat killed diverse thinking in Australian politics

**Key Argument:** The pathway to power has narrowed to a single lane — uni politics, staffer job, factional loyalty, safe seat. This pipeline systematically excludes the people who actually understand how the economy works.

**Draws From:** The Pipeline section, examples (Alex Hawke, Jim Chalmers, Tony Burke)

**Gen Z Hook:** "The bloke running the economy wrote his PhD about someone else running the economy. His real-world experience is literally theoretical. And we wonder why nothing works."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "The Treasurer's career speedrun" — animated timeline showing university → PhD → staffer → parliament → Treasurer, with a counter showing "days in private sector: 0." Instagram carousel: The Pipeline infographic.

## Post 3: "The Reform Drought"
**Subtitle:** 25 years of nothing — how career politicians traded courage for survival

**Key Argument:** Between 1983 and 2000, Australia got floating the dollar, compulsory super, Medicare, tariff reform, the GST, and gun reform. Since then? Nothing of comparable scale. Productivity growth has halved. The career politician class is structurally incapable of reform because reform requires accepting short-term unpopularity.

**Draws From:** The Reform Drought section, Productivity Commission data

**Gen Z Hook:** "Productivity growth: 2.2% in the 1990s (reform era) → 1% today (vibes era). Your living standards are stagnating because politicians are too scared to do their jobs."

**Social Media Angle:** Graph: Australia's productivity growth over time with major reforms marked. The line goes up during reform years, flatlines after. TikTok: "Name one brave reform since the GST in 2000. I'll wait." (Timer runs)

## Post 4: "Your Tax System Is Rigged"
**Subtitle:** $10.9 billion a year subsidising property investors while you can't afford rent

**Key Argument:** The Henry Tax Review recommended 138 reforms. Three were implemented. Negative gearing, the CGT discount, and multinational profit shifting have created a two-tier economy where small businesses and wage earners carry the load while property investors and multinationals game the system.

**Draws From:** The Tax System Is Broken, Taxing Billionaires and Multinationals, The Property Aristocracy

**Gen Z Hook:** "Negative gearing costs the budget $10.9 billion a year. That's $10.9 billion subsidising people who already own houses, paid for by people who can't afford one. You."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "How negative gearing actually works" — 60-sec explainer with real numbers. Instagram carousel: "138 recommendations. 3 implemented. Here's what we're missing." Shareable stat: "Your local café owner pays 25% tax. Some multinationals pay 8%. Same country."

## Post 5: "The Wave That's Already Here"
**Subtitle:** AI is eliminating white-collar jobs right now. No politician will tell you. We will.

**Key Argument:** AI is already displacing accountants, paralegals, analysts, and other white-collar workers. UBI doesn't work (the maths don't add up), regulation can't stop it (Australia is 26M people in an 8B global economy), and retraining programs are mostly theatre. We need honest transition pathways, not comfortable lies.

**Draws From:** The White Collar Apocalypse, UBI section, You Can't Stop the Wave, The Comfortable Bullshit

**Gen Z Hook:** "Everyone's arguing about whether AI will take your job. Meanwhile, the Big Four are already quietly cutting graduate intakes. The future isn't coming — check the job listings."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "Three comfortable lies about AI and jobs" — rapid-fire debunking of UBI, regulation, and retraining. Instagram: List of specific jobs already being automated with timeline estimates. Shareable: "Retraining is what politicians say when they don't have a plan."

## Post 6: "AI Won't Replace Politicians (But It Should Replace Career Politicians)"
**Subtitle:** How artificial intelligence can bring citizen legislators back to parliament

**Key Argument:** AI doesn't replace human judgment — it replaces the operational complexity that currently requires a lifetime in politics. A farmer, doctor, or small business owner augmented by AI policy advisors, constituent management tools, and impact modelling could serve effectively without becoming a career politician. That's the whole point.

**Draws From:** The AI-Enabled Citizen Legislator, Agentic AI section, A Familiar Fear, The AAIP Vision

**Gen Z Hook:** "What if your MP was a nurse who actually understood the health system, backed by AI that handles the Canberra bullshit? Instead of a staffer who's never treated a patient, backed by other staffers?"

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "What if your MP had an AI that actually modelled what a bill does to your electorate — instead of voting how the party whip told them?" Concept video: split screen of career politician reading briefing paper vs. citizen politician getting real-time AI analysis.

## Post 7: "The Skeleton Problem"
**Subtitle:** Why new parties attract weirdos — and the AI-powered solution nobody's talking about

**Key Argument:** The biggest practical challenge for any new party is candidate quality. The first people through the door are conspiracy theorists and axe-grinders, not the GP and the engineer. AI-powered vetting, reduced personal risk through AI augmentation, and proactive candidate identification can solve this — turning the new party's biggest weakness into a strength.

**Draws From:** The Skeleton Problem section

**Gen Z Hook:** "You know why you've never voted for a minor party? Because the last one had a flat-earther running in the next electorate. Here's how AI fixes candidate quality so you don't have to hold your nose."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "The skeleton problem, explained" — montage of minor party candidate scandals, then pivot to "but what if there was a better way to find good candidates?" Instagram: "The 5 types of people who join new parties first" (humorous but honest infographic).

## Post 8: "Pork Barreling Is Just Corruption With Better PR"
**Subtitle:** $660 million in car parks nobody needed, and the AI system that would stop it

**Key Argument:** Career politicians allocate public money to marginal seats, not where it's needed. Sports rorts, commuter car parks — the pattern is consistent and documented. AI-driven, transparent resource allocation would make pork barreling impossible by making the data public and the models auditable.

**Draws From:** Pork Barreling section, Sports Rorts, Commuter Car Parks

**Gen Z Hook:** "73% of sports grants went to projects the experts didn't recommend. The money went to marginal seats instead. Your tax dollars, buying someone else's votes."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: Map animation showing where grants went vs. where they were needed. The visual is devastating. Instagram carousel: "Sports Rorts by the numbers" — auditor-general data in shareable format. Quote card: "We have the data to do it properly. Career politicians choose to ignore it."

## Post 9: "The State of the Alternatives"
**Subtitle:** Greens, One Nation, teals, and the Coalition — an honest assessment of everyone failing you

**Key Argument:** The Greens have vibes but not policy. One Nation diagnoses real problems but prescribes wrong answers. The Coalition is fracturing from both flanks. The teals proved independents can win but are limited in scope. There's a genuine gap for a practical, empirical, non-ideological movement.

**Draws From:** The State of the Alternatives (Greens, One Nation, Coalition subsections), The Opportunity

**Gen Z Hook:** "The Greens want rent freezes that every economist says will reduce supply. One Nation wants to cut immigration without fixing the actual policy settings. The Liberals can't decide if they're moderates or culture warriors. Cool, cool, cool."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "Rating every party's housing policy" — rapid honest assessment, each gets 10 seconds. Instagram: Venn diagram — "What each party gets right / what they get catastrophically wrong." Quote: "One Nation's rise is a symptom, not a cause. The cause is a political class so insulated from ordinary life that they can't hear what people are actually saying."

## Post 10: "What Would an AI-Powered Parliament Actually Look Like?"
**Subtitle:** Not robot politicians — citizen politicians with superpowers

**Key Argument:** AI-augmented governance means electorate agents that model bill impacts, constituent aggregation that captures real community views (not just the loudest voices), transparent policy modelling anyone can audit, and citizen legislators who can serve without destroying their careers. The constitutional barriers are real but navigable. Here's the practical roadmap.

**Draws From:** Agentic AI section (Electorate Agent, AI Constituent Representative, Policy Impact Modelling, Digital Policy Advisor), The Constitutional Brick Wall, Longer-Term Thinking

**Gen Z Hook:** "Imagine your MP could actually tell you what a bill does to YOUR suburb — not what the party talking points say. Imagine you could tell your MP what you think and it actually got aggregated into something useful, not just filed in a drawer."

**Social Media Angle:** TikTok: "What if parliament worked like this?" — mock-up of an electorate AI dashboard showing real-time impact modelling. Split with current reality: politician reading a briefing note they don't understand. Instagram carousel: "5 levels of AI in parliament" — from research tool (boring) to autonomous representative (unconstitutional) — showing where AAIP sits (levels 1-3, aiming for 4).
