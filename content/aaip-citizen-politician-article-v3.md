# The Death of the Citizen Politician
## How Australia lost its most valuable political asset — and how AI could bring it back

---

In 1983, Bob Hawke put together a cabinet that actually looked like the country it was supposed to run.

Peter Walsh, Finance Minister, was a wheat and sheep farmer from Doodlakine — a speck on the map in WA's Wheatbelt. He slashed government waste with the ruthlessness of a bloke who'd watched bad seasons destroy good farms. Bill Hayden had been a Queensland cop. Barry Jones was a high school teacher and quiz show champion who could talk thermodynamics and Proust without coming up for air. John Button had been a solicitor who marched against Vietnam.

These weren't career politicians. They were citizens who rocked up to parliament because they had something useful to contribute. Expertise. Lived experience. A perspective that didn't come from sitting in a minister's office writing briefing papers about a world they'd never actually operated in.

The Labor tradition of citizen politicians ran deep. Kim Beazley Sr., a teacher, served from 1945 to 1977. Neal Blewett, the Health Minister who ran Australia's world-leading HIV/AIDS response — arguably the single best piece of public health policy this country has ever produced — was an academic.

Now look at the front bench of any major party today. Try to find the farmer. The doctor. The engineer. The small business owner who's actually met a payroll, chased a late-paying customer, lain awake at 2am wondering if the cash flow will cover wages on Thursday.

Good luck with that.

## The Howard Exception — Sort Of

Before we go further, I want to give credit where it's due, and this might surprise some people: John Howard.

Howard was himself the ultimate career politician — he'd been in parliament since 1974 and spent over five years as Treasurer before becoming PM. But here's the thing: he genuinely understood and championed the people who *weren't* career politicians. Specifically, small business owners.

Howard loved small business. Not in the way modern politicians "love" things — with a press release and a photo op — but in a policy-making, structural way. The GST reform in 2000 was genuinely brave policy. You can argue about the details, but replacing a cascading wholesale sales tax with a broad-based consumption tax was the kind of reform that career politicians terrified of the next poll would never touch. Howard took it to an election and won. That takes conviction.

He brought people into his ministry who'd actually done things. Brendan Nelson was a medical doctor. Warren Truss came from a grain-growing family in Queensland. Joe Hockey — whatever you think of his later performance — had actually practised law before entering politics.

WorkChoices was ideological overreach, sure. But at least it came from a genuine conviction about how workplaces should operate, not from a focus group. Compare that to the careful, poll-tested nothingness that passes for policy today.

The point is: even within the career politician framework, Howard understood that the people who actually drive this economy — the small business owners, the farmers, the tradies running crews — needed to be represented. He didn't always get it right, but he tried.

## The Reform Drought

And here's the thing about Howard's GST: it was basically the last time an Australian government did anything genuinely brave.

Think about what the Hawke and Keating governments accomplished between 1983 and 1996. They floated the Australian dollar. Introduced compulsory superannuation. Slashed tariffs that had been protecting inefficient industries for decades. Created Medicare. Implemented the National Competition Policy that forced every level of government to justify anti-competitive regulations. Deregulated the financial sector. Established enterprise bargaining.

These weren't small tweaks. They were fundamental, structural reforms that transformed the Australian economy from a protected, inward-looking backwater into a competitive, modern economy. The "recession we had to have" wasn't a slogan — it was what happened when you ripped off decades of protectionist bandaids and forced the economy to actually compete.

Then Howard came in and gave us the GST (2000) and gun reform (1996). Both genuinely courageous. Both required spending enormous political capital. Both made Australia better.

And then... nothing.

Twenty-five years. A quarter of a century. Three prime ministers from each major party. And not a single reform that comes close to the scale of what Hawke, Keating, and Howard achieved.

Why? Because the people who now run our political parties are career politicians who cannot afford to lose an election. Reform is risky. Reform creates losers as well as winners, and the losers are louder. Reform requires explaining complex trade-offs to voters, and the modern media cycle punishes complexity.

Hawke could float the dollar because he'd been president of the ACTU — he understood the economy from the inside, not from a briefing paper. Keating could slash tariffs because he'd grown up in Bankstown and understood that protecting inefficient manufacturers ultimately hurt the workers they employed. Howard could push the GST through because he'd been Treasurer for five years and genuinely understood tax policy at a deep level.

These were people with conviction born from experience. Not focus-group jockeys terrified of tomorrow's Newspoll.

The results speak for themselves. The Productivity Commission's own five-year inquiry — *Advancing Prosperity* — lays it out plainly: Australia's productivity growth has been declining for decades. Labour productivity growth averaged about 2.2% per year in the 1990s during the reform dividend years, dropped to about 1.4% in the 2000s, and has been languishing around 1% or below in recent years. The Commission identified the shift to a services economy (90% of Australians now work in services) as a key challenge, but also pointed to inadequate competition, sluggish technology adoption, and — here's the kicker — a failure to pursue the kind of structural reforms that drove the 1990s boom.

In plain English: we stopped reforming, and we stopped growing. Coincidence? Pull the other one.

The Intergenerational Reports keep warning us that without productivity improvements, an ageing population will crush the budget. Every Treasurer nods gravely, announces nothing of substance, and kicks the can to the next poor bastard.

This is what career politicians have given us. Not stability — stagnation. The most prosperous period in Australian economic history was driven by politicians who were brave enough to be unpopular. Now we have politicians whose only skill is being inoffensive, and the economy is slowly paying the price.

## The White Collar Apocalypse Is Already Here

And the reform drought is about to collide with the biggest workforce disruption since the Industrial Revolution. Except this time, it's not factory workers. It's the middle class.

Let me be blunt, because nobody in parliament will be: AI is going to eliminate millions of white collar jobs. Not might. Not could. Is. It's already started.

Accountants. Paralegals. Junior lawyers. Insurance assessors. Bank tellers and loan officers. Radiologists reading scans. Financial analysts building spreadsheet models. Junior software developers writing boilerplate code. Copywriters. Translators. Customer service reps. Administrative assistants. Real estate agents doing comparative market analyses. Tax preparers. Bookkeepers.

These aren't hypothetical future casualties. Right now, in 2026, AI systems can do most of what a graduate accountant does. They can review contracts faster and more accurately than a paralegal. They can write first drafts that are 80% as good as a junior copywriter's output — and they do it in seconds, not hours. They can read medical imaging with accuracy that matches or exceeds human radiologists in many studies.

The Big Four consulting firms are already quietly restructuring. The major banks have been shedding staff for years — not just tellers, but analysts, compliance officers, and middle management. Law firms are discovering that AI can do in minutes what used to require a team of paralegals working for weeks on document review.

This is not a drill.

### UBI Is Not the Answer

Let me head off the obvious response, because it comes up every time: "We'll just do Universal Basic Income."

No, we won't. And here's why.

First, the maths don't work. Australia has roughly 20 million adults. Even a modest UBI of $25,000 per year — well below the poverty line for a family — would cost $500 billion annually. The entire federal budget is about $680 billion. You'd need to roughly double income tax revenue or gut every other program to fund it. It's fiscal fantasy.

Second, it polls terribly. Australians — like most people — have a deep-seated belief that adults should contribute. Whether you think that's noble or puritanical, it's real, and no politician will stake their career on telling voters they're going to tax workers to pay non-workers to stay home. The 2023 Voice referendum should have taught everyone that you don't get Australians to vote for things they're uncomfortable with, no matter how good your arguments are.

Third — and this is the one that matters most — people need work. Not just income. *Work.* Purpose. Structure. Identity. The social fabric of communities. The mental health data on long-term unemployment is devastating, and it doesn't get better just because the cheque arrives on time. Paying people to exist isn't compassion — it's surrender. It's admitting you've got no better idea.

UBI is the answer you come up with when you don't understand the problem deeply enough to solve it properly.

### You Can't Stop the Wave

Here's the other fantasy: that we can regulate our way out of this. Pause AI development. Ban certain applications. Require human-in-the-loop for everything.

Australia is 26 million people in a global economy of 8 billion. We don't set the technology agenda. We don't control what OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, or the Chinese tech giants build. If we ban AI tools that the rest of the world adopts, we don't protect Australian jobs — we just make sure those jobs move offshore faster. The accounting work doesn't disappear. It just gets done in Manila or Bangalore, by AI systems built in San Francisco, for clients who used to hire Australians.

The genie is out of the bottle. It's not going back in. Every historical attempt to ban a transformative technology — from the Luddites smashing looms to taxi regulators trying to stop Uber — has failed. The technology wins. Always. The only question is whether you ride the wave or drown in it.

This isn't fatalism. It's realism. And the difference between countries that thrive through disruption and countries that get crushed by it comes down to one thing: the quality of the people making decisions during the transition.

### Why Career Politicians Are Uniquely Useless Here

This is arguably the single most important policy challenge Australia will face in the next decade. And our political class is spectacularly unequipped to handle it.

**They don't understand the technology.** Most federal parliamentarians couldn't explain the difference between machine learning and a spreadsheet macro. They get briefed by consultants who have their own agenda, and they parrot whatever sounds least scary. When they talk about AI, they talk about "guardrails" and "responsible innovation" — meaningless buzzwords that signal "I have no idea what's happening but I'd like it to slow down please."

**They're terrified of honesty.** No career politician will stand up and say: "If you're a 45-year-old accountant doing compliance work, your job is probably going to be automated within five years, and we need to talk about what comes next." That sentence — which is true — is political suicide. So instead they say nothing. Or worse, they promise that "retraining programs" will fix everything.

**Retraining is mostly bullshit.** Let's be honest about this. The idea that you can take a 50-year-old insurance assessor, put them through a six-month coding bootcamp, and turn them into a software developer is a fantasy that makes politicians feel good and achieves almost nothing. Some people can retrain. Many can't — not because they're stupid, but because learning a fundamentally new skill set in midlife, while supporting a family, with a mortgage, is brutally hard. The data on government retraining programs is grim: completion rates are low, job placement rates are lower, and salary recovery is dismal.

This doesn't mean we shouldn't invest in education and skills. We absolutely should — but honestly, targeting the *next* generation's skills rather than pretending we can wholesale retrain the current one. For the people displaced now, we need something much more creative than "learn to code."

**They have zero experience of disruption.** A career politician has never managed a team through a technology transition. They've never had to tell twenty employees that their roles are being automated. They've never had to figure out how to redeploy people whose skills are suddenly obsolete. They've never lain awake wondering whether their business model will exist in three years. They have — quite literally — no idea what this feels like or how to navigate it, because they've spent their entire career in the one industry that's immune to market forces.

### What Actually Needs to Happen

Alright, enough about what won't work. Here's what might.

**An honest national conversation.** Start by telling the truth. Commission a genuine, independent assessment of which Australian jobs are most exposed to AI automation, on what timeline, with what severity. Not a vague "future of work" report full of consultant waffle. A specific, sector-by-sector, occupation-by-occupation analysis. Publish it. Let people see where they stand. Treat voters like adults. This is exactly the kind of analysis that AI itself could help produce — modelling the impact transparently so people can plan.

**Genuine transition pathways, not retraining theatre.** For displaced workers, the answer isn't "learn to code." It's a mix of approaches:

- *Adjacent role transition:* The accountant doesn't become a coder — she becomes an AI-augmented financial advisor, using her domain expertise alongside AI tools. The paralegal becomes a legal technology specialist. You don't throw away decades of domain knowledge; you augment it.
- *Entrepreneurship support:* This connects directly to the SME theme. Many displaced white collar workers have deep industry expertise and professional networks. With the right support — capital, mentoring, reduced regulatory burden — they can start businesses that combine their knowledge with AI capabilities. The ABS data shows 437,000 new business entries per year. Make it easier for displaced workers to be among them.
- *New categories of work:* AI creates new roles as well as destroying old ones. AI trainers, prompt engineers, AI ethicists, human-AI workflow designers, AI audit specialists. These don't require starting from scratch — they require adapting existing expertise to new tools.
- *Portable benefits:* Decouple health insurance, superannuation, and other benefits from traditional full-time employment. The future of work is more fluid — contracting, freelancing, portfolio careers, small business. The benefits system needs to reflect that reality instead of assuming everyone has a single employer for forty years.

**Tax reform to share the gains.** Here's the thing that nobody's talking about: when a company replaces 100 workers with AI, its productivity goes through the roof. Profits soar. But those gains flow almost entirely to shareholders and executives. The 100 displaced workers get nothing — worse than nothing, they get a redundancy package and a JobSeeker queue.

This isn't sustainable and it isn't fair. If AI-driven productivity gains are going to be massive — and they will be — the tax system needs to ensure those gains are shared. Not through punitive measures, but through smart policy: higher company tax on AI-derived productivity gains could fund transition programs. A broadened resource rent tax concept applied to AI — you're extracting value from a technological resource, and some of that value should flow back to the community. Closing the loopholes that let multinationals hoard AI productivity gains offshore.

This is where the tax reform section of this article connects directly to the workforce disruption. It's not two separate problems. It's one problem: the gains from AI will be enormous, and without deliberate policy intervention, those gains will concentrate in the hands of people who already have capital while the people who actually lose their jobs get nothing.

**Support small business as the absorption mechanism.** Every major economic disruption in history has seen small businesses absorb displaced workers — either as employers or as vehicles for self-employment. The SME sector is where displaced white collar workers will land, either starting their own AI-augmented businesses or joining small firms that need their expertise.

This means getting serious about reducing the regulatory and tax burden on small business. It means making it easier to start a business, not harder. It means fixing the insane disparity where a sole trader pays 30%+ effective tax while a multinational pays 8%. It means ensuring that AI tools are accessible and affordable for small businesses, not locked up in enterprise pricing tiers that only corporates can afford.

### Why This Is the AAIP's Strongest Argument

This — more than anything else — is why Australia needs people in parliament who've actually been in industry.

When the wave hits — and it's already hitting — we need members of parliament who have managed workforces through disruption. Who understand what automation does to a team. Who know the difference between a role that's being eliminated and a role that's being transformed. Who've actually had to figure out what to do with good people whose jobs have changed under their feet.

We need the tech entrepreneur who's deployed AI in a business and seen firsthand which jobs it replaces and which it enhances. The manufacturing manager who automated a production line and had to redeploy forty people. The small business owner who adopted AI tools and found they needed *different* staff, not fewer staff. The HR director who actually ran a restructure, not the political staffer who read a briefing note about one.

A parliament full of career politicians will respond to the AI workforce disruption with a press conference, a "future of work" taskforce, and a retraining program that doesn't work. Because that's what they always do. It's all they know how to do.

A parliament with citizen legislators — people who've lived through industry disruption, who understand technology not from briefing papers but from deploying it — would respond with honesty, creativity, and genuine policy. Because they'd actually understand the problem.

The AI workforce disruption is coming whether we're ready or not. The question is whether the people making decisions when it hits have ever made a consequential decision in their lives, or whether they've spent their entire careers avoiding them.

## The People We're Not Representing

Let's talk about who's actually missing from the conversation.

As of June 2025, the ABS counts 2,729,648 actively trading businesses in Australia, with 994,178 of those employing staff. The vast majority — about 97% — are small or medium enterprises. These SMEs employ around 7.4 million people, roughly 68% of all private sector employment. They contribute about $700 billion to GDP annually — somewhere around a third of the total.

Read that again. Two-thirds of all private sector jobs. A third of GDP. Created by people who are essentially invisible in our current political system.

The ABS data also tells us something about the dynamism of the Australian economy: in 2024-25 alone, 437,150 new businesses entered the market while 370,500 exited. That's a 16.4% entry rate and 13.9% exit rate. These aren't abstract numbers — they represent hundreds of thousands of Australians taking a punt, building something, employing people, and sometimes failing and starting again. The creative destruction that actually drives an economy forward.

These aren't people who have time to spend fifteen years climbing the factional ladder. They're too busy running businesses, employing people, and actually contributing to the economy that politicians love to take credit for.

When was the last time a sitting member of parliament's most recent job before politics was "ran a landscaping business with twelve employees"? Or "owned three cafés"? Or "built a plumbing company from scratch over twenty years"?

These people are the backbone of the Australian economy and they have essentially zero direct representation in parliament. Instead, they're represented by people whose career arc goes: university politics → political staffer → factional player → safe seat → frontbench.

It's bullshit. And everybody knows it's bullshit. But the system keeps selecting for the same type of person because the system was built *by* that type of person.

---

## The Pipeline

Something profound shifted in Australian politics over the past three decades, and it wasn't subtle.

The pathway to power narrowed to a single lane:

**University politics → political staffer → factional player → safe seat → frontbench.**

Mark Latham — whatever you think of his later spiral into weirdness — identified this trend early. In *The Latham Diaries* he described a Labor Party increasingly dominated by people whose entire adult lives had been spent inside the political machine. The Australian Parliamentary Library's research backs it up: the proportion of federal parliamentarians who previously worked as political staffers, party officials, or union officials has risen steadily since the 1990s, while those from small business, farming, medicine, engineering, and teaching have fallen off a cliff.

Consider the typical modern Australian minister's CV.

Alex Hawke: president of the NSW Young Liberals at uni, political staffer, then parliament at 30. Tony Burke: student politics, union organiser, parliament at 34 — virtually no time in a job that didn't involve the political-industrial complex. Jim Chalmers, the current Treasurer: university, PhD on Paul Keating, chief of staff to Wayne Swan, parliament. His real-world economic experience is entirely theoretical. This bloke is running the economy and his deepest private sector experience is... writing a thesis about someone else running the economy.

This isn't a partisan problem. Both major parties have evolved internal cultures that reward loyalty, factional navigation, and message discipline over knowing what the hell you're talking about. The skills that get you preselected — factional deal-making, media management, saying nothing of substance with great conviction — are completely different from the skills that make good policy.

The 47th Parliament was notable for the "teal" independents, but even many of these came from corporate, legal, or NGO backgrounds. The farmer, the nurse, the sparky running a small crew — still locked out.

---

## The State of the Alternatives

So the major parties are broken. The pipeline selects for careerists. Surely one of the minor parties or crossbenchers is filling the gap?

Let's take an honest look.

### The Greens: Vibes Aren't Policy

The Greens have become a protest party masquerading as a governing party. Their policies read beautifully on a placard but fall apart the moment someone asks "okay, how?"

Take housing. The Greens' housing platform would, by most serious economic analysis, make the problem worse — rent freezes that discourage supply, opposition to density in the very inner-city areas where their voters live, and a "build more public housing" commitment with no credible funding model. Climate policy with no transition plan for the workers in fossil fuel industries whose jobs will actually disappear. "Just stop it" isn't a plan. It's a bumper sticker.

The party has been increasingly captured by inner-city activism that is genuinely disconnected from suburban and regional Australia. A barista in Fitzroy and a nurse in Logan have very different housing problems. The Greens talk to one and ignore the other.

Their vote share is plateauing as Australians — including the pragmatic environmentalists who used to be their base — realise that righteous anger doesn't keep the lights on. The teals are eating their lunch among educated moderates who want climate action *and* economic literacy. The Greens' response has been to go harder left, which energises the base and alienates everyone else.

I'm not dismissing the Greens entirely. They've been useful on some integrity and environmental issues. But they are not a serious alternative for governance. They're a pressure group with parliamentary seats.

### One Nation: Filling the Vacuum

Pauline Hanson is back. Again. And before you roll your eyes, ask yourself *why*.

One Nation keeps resurfacing because there is a genuine vacuum in Australian politics. Working-class Australians — the tradie in Ipswich, the factory worker in Elizabeth, the retail worker in Townsville — feel unrepresented. Not just by the major parties, but by the Greens too, whose concerns about pronouns and Palestine feel a million miles from the kitchen table.

These Australians are worried about immigration — not because they're racist, but because they can see the pressure on housing, hospitals, roads, and schools, and nobody in the major parties will acknowledge it honestly. They're worried about cost of living. They're worried about job security. They're watching their kids fail to buy a home and their wages stagnate while politicians tell them the economy is "strong."

One Nation fills that gap with simple answers to complex problems. Are those answers usually wrong? Yes. Is "just cut immigration" a serious economic policy? No. But here's the thing that career politicians on both sides refuse to understand: it's not that One Nation voters are stupid. It's that *nobody else is even acknowledging their concerns*.

When a working-class Australian raises immigration as an issue, the career politician class doesn't engage with the legitimate economic anxiety underneath — the housing competition, the wage pressure, the infrastructure strain. Instead, they dismiss the concern as racist or ignorant, and then act surprised when those voters find someone who'll at least pretend to listen.

One Nation's rise is a symptom, not a cause. The cause is a political class so insulated from ordinary life that they can't hear what people are actually saying.

### The Coalition: Fracturing from Both Sides

The Liberal-National Coalition is in deep structural trouble, and it's not the kind you fix with a leadership change.

The teals took the moderate flank. Educated, wealthy, socially progressive voters in seats like Goldstein, Kooyong, Wentworth, and North Sydney — traditional Liberal heartland — looked at the party's climate denialism, integrity failures, and culture war obsessions and said "nah." Those seats aren't coming back easily. The teal movement has established itself, has incumbency advantage, and represents a genuine realignment of moderate liberal voters.

Meanwhile, One Nation is eating the right flank. Working-class voters in outer suburban and regional seats who used to hold their nose and vote Liberal are peeling off to a party that at least talks about their concerns, however crudely.

Peter Dutton's strategy of going harder right to shore up the conservative base just accelerates the teal losses. Every time he dog-whistles on immigration or culture wars, another moderate Liberal voter in a leafy suburb decides they'd rather vote for the local teal independent who has an actual climate policy and doesn't embarrass them at dinner parties.

The Nationals are increasingly irrelevant as regional Australia changes. The family farm is giving way to corporate agriculture. Regional towns are diversifying — or dying. The old National Party model of representing "the bush" doesn't map onto a regional Australia that now includes tree-changers, remote workers, renewable energy projects, and mining communities with very different interests.

This dysfunction means Australia likely won't have an effective opposition for years. And regardless of which side you're on, that's bad for democracy. Good governance needs good opposition. Accountability requires a credible alternative government. When the opposition is too busy fighting itself to hold the government to account, everyone loses.

### The Opportunity

Here's the thing about political fragmentation: it creates space.

The major parties are hollowed out. The Greens are stuck in a protest loop. One Nation diagnoses real problems but prescribes the wrong medicine. The Coalition is tearing itself apart. The teals proved that well-funded, community-backed independents can win — but they're mostly single-issue (climate and integrity) and concentrated in wealthy inner-city seats.

There is a genuine gap in Australian politics for something new. Not left, not right — *practical*. Not ideological — *empirical*. A political movement that takes the legitimate concerns of One Nation voters seriously without the xenophobia. That shares the Greens' urgency on climate without the economic illiteracy. That believes in markets like the Liberals used to, but also believes in fairness like Labor used to.

The AAIP doesn't need to win government. That's not the play, and anyone who tells you a new party can form government in the short term is dreaming. The play is to win enough seats to hold the balance of power and force evidence-based policy into the national conversation. The way the teals forced climate and integrity onto the agenda, but broader — on AI, productivity, tax reform, workforce transition, housing supply, competition policy.

The crossbench is where Australian politics is heading whether the major parties like it or not. The question is whether that crossbench is populated by protest votes and personality cults, or by serious people with real expertise who are there to get things done.

That's the gap. That's the opportunity. And that's exactly what the current political landscape — fractured, dysfunctional, and unable to produce a single brave reform — is crying out for.

## When the System Meets an Outsider

Want to know what happens when someone with genuine outside experience enters Australian politics? Look at Malcolm Turnbull.

Rhodes Scholar. Successful barrister — he defended Peter Wright in the Spycatcher trial and won against the British government. Merchant banker. Internet entrepreneur — a key investor in OzEmail, helping transform it into one of Australia's first major ISPs, when most Australians didn't know what email was. Venture capitalist.

He'd built things. Made money. Operated in a world where decisions have consequences that can't be managed with a press release.

He became PM in 2015. His own party knifed him in 2018. Not because he lost an election. Not because of a scandal. Because he was insufficiently tribal. Because he thought about policy in terms of outcomes rather than factional positioning. Because he couldn't fully suppress the instincts of someone who'd spent decades solving real problems in favour of the political instinct to solve for tomorrow's Newspoll.

The pattern repeats. Craig Emerson, a genuine economist, got sidelined in Labor. John Hewson led the Liberals with a detailed policy platform — Fightback! — and was punished for having too much substance and not enough political cunning. Keating's "the unloseable election" line is funny, but the underlying message is grim: substance loses to politics.

Kerryn Phelps — a practising GP who won Wentworth in a by-election and brought genuine medical expertise to parliament. She lost her seat at the next general election, just seven months later. The system absorbed the shock and moved on.

The message is clear: real-world expertise is tolerated in Australian politics, but it is not rewarded. The system is optimised for career politicians and will, over time, select for them or reshape them.

## Pork Barreling: Where Career Politicians Really Shine

If you want to understand the damage career politicians do, follow the money.

Not the money that goes where it's needed. The money that goes where the votes are.

Australia has a proud and inglorious tradition of pork barreling — directing public funds to marginal electorates to buy votes rather than allocating them based on, you know, actual need.

The **Sports Rorts affair** under Bridget McKenzie in 2019-2020 was the poster child. The Australian National Audit Office found that grants from the $102.5 million Community Sport Infrastructure Program were overwhelmingly directed to marginal or targeted electorates — not to where they were most needed. A colour-coded spreadsheet literally tracked which electorates were targets. In the first round, 41% of approved projects weren't on Sport Australia's recommended list. By the third round, that number hit 73%. Seventy-three percent of the money went to projects that the people who actually assessed merit *didn't recommend*. McKenzie eventually resigned — but technically for failing to declare membership of a club that received funding, not for the rorts themselves. The practice didn't stop. It never does.

Then there was the **Commuter Car Parks** program. The ANAO found that the $660 million Urban Congestion Fund was used to promise car parks overwhelmingly in Coalition-held or targeted marginal seats, with limited evidence of genuine merit-based assessment. Sites were chosen by the then-PM's office, not by the relevant department based on need.

These aren't isolated incidents. They're features, not bugs, of a system run by career politicians whose primary skill is winning elections. When your entire career depends on holding your seat, every spending decision gets filtered through "does this help me win?" rather than "does this help the people who need it most?"

Here's what kills me about this: we have the data to do it properly. We know where the congestion is. We know which sports facilities are falling apart. We know which communities are underserved. The data exists. Career politicians choose to ignore it because the data doesn't care about marginal seats.

This is one of the areas where AI-driven governance could make an immediate, tangible difference. Imagine resource allocation models that are transparent, data-driven, and publicly auditable. No colour-coded spreadsheets in a minister's office. No quiet phone calls from the PM's office telling the department which car parks to fund. Just: here's where the need is, here's where the money should go, here's the model, here are the inputs, anyone can check our work.

Career politicians would hate this. Which tells you everything you need to know about whether it's a good idea.

## The Tax System Is Broken (And Everyone Knows It)

Let's talk about the elephant in every room in Canberra: Australia's tax system is a rigged game, and career politicians are too gutless to fix it.

In 2008, the Rudd government commissioned the Henry Tax Review — a "root and branch" review of Australia's entire tax system. The panel, chaired by Treasury Secretary Ken Henry, spent two years doing genuinely rigorous work. They came back with 138 recommendations across nine themes: simplifying personal income tax (higher tax-free threshold, only two brackets), reforming land and resource taxation, moving from stamp duty to land tax, fixing the interaction between the tax and transfer systems, and creating a more neutral treatment of rental and owner-occupied housing.

One hundred and thirty-eight recommendations. Evidence-based. Carefully modelled. Exactly the kind of reform agenda that could have set Australia up for the next twenty years.

The Rudd government implemented three of them. Three out of 138.

The major one — the Resource Super Profits Tax — was so badly handled politically that it contributed to Rudd losing the leadership to Gillard. Gillard watered it down to the Mineral Resource Rent Tax. Abbott repealed even that. The other 135 recommendations? Collecting dust. Sixteen years later, we're still talking about the same problems the Henry Review identified, and we've done precisely nothing about them.

Why? Because every single one of those reforms would create losers. And career politicians whose entire existence depends on not creating losers will never, ever touch them.

### The Property Aristocracy

Take housing. Australia has created a two-tier society: people who own property and people who probably never will. The mechanisms are well-understood and not controversial among economists:

**Negative gearing** lets property investors claim losses on investment properties against their wage income. The Grattan Institute has shown this disproportionately benefits higher-income taxpayers. In 2023-24, negative gearing cost the federal budget $10.9 billion in foregone personal income tax revenue — projected to hit $12.3 billion in 2024-25. That's not a rounding error. That's a policy choice to subsidise people who already have property at the expense of people who don't.

**The capital gains tax discount** — introduced by Howard in 1999, replacing the previous inflation-indexation method — means that if you hold an asset for more than twelve months, you only pay tax on half the gain. Combined with negative gearing, this creates a beautiful arbitrage: claim your losses at your full marginal rate, then pay tax on your gains at half your marginal rate. It's a wealth-generation machine for people who already have assets, funded by the tax system.

The Reserve Bank itself — not exactly a radical organisation — told the Productivity Commission back in 2003 that "resources and finance are being disproportionately channelled into" property investment, and that "the most sensible area to look for moderation of demand is among investors."

That was 2003. Twenty-two years ago. The median house price in Sydney has roughly tripled since then. We've done nothing.

Every economist worth listening to — Saul Eslake, the Grattan Institute, the Productivity Commission — says the same thing: negative gearing and the CGT discount inflate house prices, transfer wealth from young to old, from renters to owners, and from have-nots to haves. Deloitte Access Economics modelled that reforming negative gearing and the CGT discount would reduce property prices by about 4.6% nationally (8.3% in Sydney and Melbourne) and reduce rents by 0.5%.

But Labor took negative gearing reform to two elections (2016 and 2019) and lost both times. The lesson the career politicians took from that? Never touch it again. The lesson they *should* have taken? If you can't explain good policy to voters, that's a failure of communication, not a failure of policy.

### The Stage 3 Debacle

The stage 3 tax cuts tell you everything about modern Australian political courage. Originally legislated by the Turnbull government as modest bracket adjustments, the Morrison government blew them out to an additional $90 billion in cuts — totalling $254 billion over ten years — overwhelmingly benefiting higher earners. The Parliamentary Budget Office found that 48% of the benefits would go to people earning above $180,000.

Labor opposed them in opposition. Then voted for them — Albanese claiming they didn't want to block the earlier stages. Then promised to keep them at the 2022 election. Then modified them in January 2024, reducing the giveaway to high earners and spreading more to middle incomes.

The policy substance of the modification was reasonable. But the process — promising one thing at an election, doing another eighteen months later — corroded trust in a way that transcends the specific policy. Career politicians so terrified of losing an election that they make promises they know are bad policy, then break those promises when the political calculus shifts. Heads they win, tails we lose.

An AI-augmented parliament with citizen legislators who aren't career-dependent could actually model tax changes transparently, show the distributional impacts in real time, and make the case for evidence-based reform without the constant paralysing fear that any bold move will cost them their job.

## Taxing Billionaires and Multinationals: The Common Sense Position

Here's where I need to be really clear, because this territory gets colonised by populist nutjobs on both sides.

I'm not talking about "eat the rich" socialism. I'm not talking about punitive taxation that drives capital offshore. I'm talking about the blindingly obvious observation that Australia's tax base is being eroded by multinational profit shifting and that the burden is falling disproportionately on small businesses and wage earners.

The numbers are stark. The OECD estimates that base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) — the technical term for multinationals using fancy accounting to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions — costs governments globally between $100 and $240 billion per year, or 4-10% of total corporate income tax collection. In Australia, the ATO's own data shows that some of the largest companies operating here pay effective tax rates in the single digits, while your local café owner pays 25% on every dollar of profit and has zero capacity for "transfer pricing" to a subsidiary in Ireland.

The wealth concentration data tells the same story. The top 1% wealth share in Australia has grown from roughly 15% in the early 1990s to around 25% today. This isn't because the rich got smarter or worked harder. It's because the system — from property tax concessions to multinational profit shifting to the erosion of progressive taxation — has been steadily tilted in favour of those who already have capital.

This is where a centrist, evidence-based position matters:

**Close the loopholes.** The OECD's BEPS framework exists. The Pillar Two global minimum tax of 15% for multinationals with revenue over €750 million is a start. Australia has signed on. Now implement it properly and stop letting companies exploit mismatches between jurisdictions.

**Minimum effective tax rates.** If a company generates revenue in Australia, it should pay a meaningful rate of tax in Australia. Not the statutory 30% that nobody actually pays, but a genuine minimum effective rate that can't be engineered away.

**Proper transfer pricing enforcement.** When a multinational charges its Australian subsidiary a billion dollars in "management fees" or "intellectual property licensing" to shift profits to Singapore or Luxembourg, the ATO should have the resources and mandate to challenge it. Currently, it's a David and Goliath fight where David has a budget cut every year.

**AI could transform this.** Imagine transparent modelling of the actual revenue impacts of tax reform — not the hand-wavy "economic modelling" that lobby groups commission to get the answer they want, but genuine, open-source, auditable models that any citizen can examine. "If we implement a 15% minimum effective corporate tax rate, here's the revenue impact, here are the companies affected, here are the second-order effects on investment and employment." Make it public. Let people see the numbers. Trust citizens to handle the truth.

This isn't radical. This is what every small business owner in Australia already instinctively knows: the system is rigged, and they're on the wrong side of the rig. A parliament full of citizen legislators — people who've actually run businesses and paid their taxes without the benefit of a Big Four accounting firm — would fix this in a heartbeat. Career politicians won't, because the multinationals and property lobbies fund their campaigns.

## The Economics of Common Sense

I want to be explicit about the economic philosophy underlying all of this, because in modern Australian politics, everything gets forced into a left-right binary that doesn't actually describe how the economy works.

This isn't left-wing economics. It isn't right-wing economics. It's evidence-based economics — the kind that actual economists across the political spectrum broadly agree on, even if politicians pretend otherwise.

**Efficient markets need regulation.** This is not a controversial statement among economists. Market failures are real — externalities, information asymmetries, natural monopolies, public goods. Adam Smith himself would have told you that. The question isn't "regulation or no regulation" — it's "smart regulation or dumb regulation." The Hawke/Keating reforms weren't deregulation in the naive libertarian sense; they were *re*-regulation — removing stupid protections and replacing them with smarter frameworks.

**Progressive taxation is efficient.** This comes from basic economics: the diminishing marginal utility of income. A dollar means more to someone earning $50,000 than to someone earning $500,000. Progressive taxation isn't class warfare — it's an efficient way to fund public goods while minimising the welfare impact on taxpayers. Every serious economist from Adam Smith to Greg Mankiw accepts this.

**Competition is good — but monopolies and oligopolies need breaking.** Australia is one of the most concentrated economies in the developed world. Four banks. Two supermarkets. Two airlines. Three telcos. The lack of competition costs Australian consumers billions and suppresses innovation. The Productivity Commission's *Advancing Prosperity* report specifically calls out inadequate competition as a drag on productivity growth.

**Free trade with safety nets.** Not protectionism — the Hawke/Keating tariff reductions made Australia richer, full stop. But also not abandonment — when trade shifts destroy communities, the answer is adjustment assistance, retraining, and transition support. Not pretending it didn't happen.

**Invest in education and infrastructure.** Human capital is everything. The Productivity Commission identifies workforce skills and technology adoption as the two biggest levers for lifting productivity. Every dollar spent on quality education returns multiples over decades. This isn't spending — it's investment. Ross Garnaut's work on the Asian century, the Grattan Institute's research on school funding and skills, Saul Eslake's relentless advocacy for evidence-based policy — they all point in the same direction: invest in people.

**Fiscal responsibility means investing wisely, not just cutting.** The most fiscally irresponsible thing a government can do is cut investment in the things that generate future growth — education, infrastructure, R&D — in order to deliver a short-term surplus that makes the Treasurer look good on the nightly news. Genuine fiscal conservatism is about making sure every dollar generates value, not about spending as little as possible.

None of this is controversial among economists. It only becomes controversial when it enters the political arena, because career politicians have incentives to promise simple answers to complex questions, and evidence-based policy is stubbornly, frustratingly nuanced.

A parliament of citizen legislators — people who've actually run businesses, managed budgets, dealt with market realities — wouldn't need this explained to them. They'd already know it from lived experience. The farmer understands market dynamics. The GP understands the healthcare system. The small business owner understands the tax burden. The engineer understands infrastructure.

That's the parliament we should have. Instead, we have a parliament of people who understand factions.

## The Wave That's Already Here

Let's stop talking about AI as a future disruption. It's not future. It's now.

Artificial intelligence is going to eliminate — not change, not "transform," *eliminate* — massive numbers of white-collar jobs in Australia. Accountants. Lawyers. Paralegals. Financial analysts. Junior software developers. Radiologists. Insurance assessors. Bank lending officers. Administrative staff across every sector. If your job involves processing information, applying rules to data, or generating documents from templates, an AI can already do it faster, cheaper, and — increasingly — better than you can.

This isn't science fiction. The Big Four accounting firms are already deploying AI that does in seconds what a graduate accountant takes hours to do. Law firms are using AI for contract review, due diligence, and legal research that used to employ armies of paralegals. Radiology AI is reading scans with accuracy that matches or exceeds human specialists. Banks are automating loan assessments. Insurance companies are automating claims processing. Every single one of these industries is quietly reducing headcount while publicly talking about "augmentation" and "upskilling."

They're lying. Or at best, they're being diplomatic about the bloodbath that's coming.

### The Comfortable Bullshit

Every time this comes up in public debate, you get served one of three comfortable lies.

**Lie #1: "Universal Basic Income will fix it."** UBI is a pipe dream. It polls terribly with the Australian public — and for good reason. Paying every Australian adult even a modest $25,000 a year would cost $500 billion annually. The entire federal budget is about $680 billion. The numbers don't work, and everybody who's done the maths knows the numbers don't work. But here's the deeper problem: people need work. Not just for money — for purpose, dignity, identity, structure. Ask anyone who's been unemployed for six months. Paying people to exist isn't a solution. It's a surrender.

**Lie #2: "We can regulate AI to protect jobs."** No, we can't. Australia is 26 million people in a global economy of 8 billion. If we over-regulate AI, companies don't stop using it — they move the work offshore to jurisdictions that don't. We've already seen this with manufacturing. We've already seen it with call centres. We'll see it with knowledge work too, except faster, because you don't need to build a factory in Vietnam. You just need a server. The genie is out of the bottle and it is not going back in. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant or lying to get your vote.

**Lie #3: "Retraining will transition displaced workers."** This is the one that really shits me, because it sounds reasonable and it's almost entirely wrong. Government retraining programs have an abysmal track record worldwide. The idea that a 52-year-old accountant who's spent 30 years doing tax returns is going to "retrain" as a cybersecurity specialist or an AI prompt engineer is fantasy. Some people will retrain successfully. Most won't. The evidence from every previous wave of automation — from manufacturing to mining — shows that displaced workers over 45 overwhelmingly end up in lower-paid, less-skilled work, or leave the workforce entirely. "Retraining" is what politicians say when they don't have an actual plan.

### The Only Honest Position

Here's the truth that no career politician in Australia has the guts to say out loud: **a lot of jobs are going away, and they're not coming back.**

Not all of them. AI will transform many roles rather than eliminate them — the accountant who becomes an AI-augmented financial advisor, the lawyer who uses AI to handle routine work and focuses on complex strategy, the radiologist who uses AI as a second reader. But the net effect on employment in these sectors will be massively negative. Fewer people will be needed. That's the whole point of the technology.

The choice facing Australia isn't "AI or no AI." That choice doesn't exist. The choice is: do we ride this wave intelligently, or do we get smashed by it while our politicians are still arguing about whether it's really happening?

Riding the wave means:

**Having an honest national conversation about which jobs go and which transform.** Not in five years. Now. Industry by industry, sector by sector. Which roles are being automated? What's the timeline? What does the transition look like? Australians deserve the truth, not platitudes.

**Massive investment in genuine transition pathways** — and I don't mean six-month certificate courses at a TAFE that hasn't updated its curriculum since 2019. I mean serious, funded, long-term programs designed with actual input from the industries doing the displacing. Apprenticeship-style transitions. Paid retraining with income support that reflects what people were actually earning. Programs designed for adults with mortgages and families, not for 22-year-olds with no commitments.

**Creating new work categories that combine human judgment with AI capability.** The jobs of the future won't be "human does everything" or "AI does everything." They'll be hybrids — humans providing judgment, empathy, creativity, and ethical oversight while AI provides speed, scale, and analytical horsepower. But these job categories don't just appear. They need to be designed, supported, and valued.

**Tax reform that ensures AI productivity gains are shared.** This is the big one. When a company replaces 100 workers with AI, the productivity gains are enormous. Under the current system, those gains flow almost entirely to shareholders and executives. That's not just unfair — it's economically stupid, because it concentrates wealth while destroying the consumer spending power that drives the economy. We need mechanisms — whether it's adjusted corporate tax rates, AI productivity levies, or mandatory transition funding — that ensure the gains from automation are broadly shared.

**Portable benefits not tied to employment.** Our entire social safety net — superannuation, workers' comp, sick leave, parental leave — is built around the assumption of stable, long-term employment. That model is dying. The gig economy already strained it. AI displacement will shatter it. We need benefits that follow the person, not the job.

**Supporting SME entrepreneurship as the landing zone for displaced workers.** When large companies automate, the displaced workers need somewhere to go. Small and medium businesses — the sector that already employs two-thirds of Australia's private workforce — are the natural landing zone. But starting a business is hard, risky, and expensive. We need dramatically better support: streamlined regulation, access to capital, mentoring programs, and tax incentives that make it viable for a displaced accountant to start a financial advisory practice or a displaced analyst to launch a consulting firm.

### Why Career Politicians Can't Handle This

This is exactly the kind of challenge that the current political class is constitutionally incapable of addressing.

Career politicians don't understand the technology. I don't mean they can't use ChatGPT — I mean they don't understand what agentic AI systems can do, how quickly the capability is advancing, or what the second and third-order effects on the economy will be. You can't make good policy about something you fundamentally don't understand.

They're terrified of saying "your job is going away." Every focus group tells them voters don't want to hear it. So they don't say it. They talk about "embracing the future" and "ensuring no one is left behind" — meaningless pablum that commits them to nothing and prepares no one for what's actually coming.

They offer vague "retraining" promises because it sounds like they have a plan. They don't have a plan. They have a talking point.

And they have zero lived experience of industry disruption. Not one member of the current cabinet has ever managed a workforce through a technology transition. Not one has ever had to look an employee in the eye and say "your role is being automated and here's what we're going to do about it." Not one has ever rebuilt a business model from the ground up because the old one stopped working.

This is *exactly* why Australia needs people in parliament who've been in industry. Who've managed through disruption. Who understand — from personal, painful experience — what automation does to a workforce and a community. Who've actually had to figure out how to transition people, not just talk about it from a lectern.

Australia can navigate this. We're a wealthy, educated, adaptable country with strong institutions and a culture of pragmatism. But we won't navigate it with a parliament full of people whose primary expertise is winning preselection battles. We'll navigate it with people who've actually been in the trenches — and who have the guts to tell the truth about what's coming.

The current political class is not those people. Not even close.

## A Familiar Fear

Here's where it gets interesting — and where the story connects to tech in a way that hits close to home for me.

Career politicians watching the rise of AI are experiencing exactly the same existential dread that software developers feel watching AI write code.

Think about it. A mid-career developer who spent 15 years mastering React, or Kubernetes, or whatever the stack du jour is, suddenly faces a world where an AI can generate competent code in seconds. Their response is predictable and deeply human: protect the craft, emphasise what AI "can't do," lobby for regulations that preserve human primacy.

Career politicians are in exactly the same position. They spent 20 years climbing the greasy pole — learning to navigate factions, manage media cycles, trade favours, and say nothing of substance with great conviction. These are *skills*. But they're the skills of political survival, not governance.

If AI tools can handle policy complexity, legislative drafting, constituent management, and data analysis — then what exactly does the career politician bring that a smart citizen with domain expertise couldn't?

The instinct, in both cases, is to protect the career rather than embrace what the disruption makes possible.

Software developers who embrace AI become dramatically more productive. They move up the stack — from writing boilerplate to designing systems, from implementing features to defining products. The ones who resist become irrelevant.

Same logic applies to politics. The question isn't whether AI will change governance. It's whether we'll let the incumbents define the terms of that change to protect their own positions.

## Agentic AI: Way More Than a Chatbot

Let's get specific about what we're actually talking about here, because "AI tools" is vague and sounds like a press release. I'm talking about agentic AI — autonomous AI systems that don't just answer questions but actively work on your behalf.

This is where it gets genuinely exciting, and I think most people haven't thought about it deeply enough.

### The Electorate Agent

Imagine an AI agent trained on the specific data of an electorate. Not a generic chatbot. An agent that has ingested:

- ABS census data for every SA1 in the electorate
- Local council planning documents and development applications
- Historical constituent correspondence — every email, letter, and phone call logged by the member's office
- Local media coverage
- Economic data — employment figures, industry composition, business registrations
- Infrastructure reports, traffic data, hospital wait times, school enrolment numbers
- Environmental data — water quality, air quality, flood risk mapping

Now imagine this agent is fine-tuned to represent the specific interests of that electorate. Not Wentworth's interests. Not Longman's interests. *This* electorate's interests, based on what the actual people who live there care about.

When a bill comes before parliament, this agent could model the specific impact on the electorate. Not in a vague "this might affect regional areas" way, but precisely: "This change to water allocation policy will affect 340 irrigators in the northern part of the electorate, reduce water availability by approximately 12% in dry years, and impact an estimated $45 million in agricultural output."

That's not replacing the member's judgment. That's informing it with data that no human could synthesise in the time available.

### The AI Constituent Representative

Here's where it gets really interesting. What if the electorate's AI agent could aggregate constituent views — not through the garbage-in-garbage-out process of petition sites, but through structured engagement?

Imagine constituents being able to interact with their electorate's AI agent to express views on upcoming legislation. Not a binary yes/no poll — actual engagement where the AI asks clarifying questions, understands context, and builds a nuanced picture of what the community wants and why.

The agent could then present the member with something like: "On the proposed housing density bill, your electorate's views break down as follows: 62% support increased density in the commercial corridor, 84% oppose changes to heritage overlay areas, the most common concern is parking availability (raised by 43% of respondents), and small business owners specifically flag the impact on commercial rents."

This isn't direct democracy in the naive sense of everyone voting on everything. It's *informed* representation — giving the member a genuine, data-backed understanding of what their electorate wants, rather than relying on whatever the loudest voices on talkback radio said this morning.

### Policy Impact Modelling

An agentic AI could model policy impacts *before* a vote, across every electorate simultaneously. Not the hand-wavy "economic modelling" that Treasury does over six months — real-time, granular modelling that says: "If this tax change passes, here's the impact on every electorate, broken down by income quintile, industry sector, and family composition."

Every member could walk into the chamber knowing exactly what a vote means for their constituents. Not what the party whip told them. Not what the lobby group's slick PDF claimed. Actual, auditable, transparent modelling.

### The Digital Policy Advisor

Beyond electorate-specific work, AI agents could serve as genuine policy advisors — and better ones than the twenty-something political staffers who currently fill that role.

A citizen politician — our farmer from the Darling Downs — could have an AI policy advisor that's been trained on agricultural policy, trade agreements, environmental regulation, and water law. Not a generalist who's good at everything and expert at nothing, but a genuinely deep specialist that can go toe-to-toe with any departmental briefing.

The same farmer could also have agents covering health policy, defence, and economic regulation — areas where she has less personal expertise but where her agent can bring her up to speed in minutes rather than months.

This is what breaks the "apprenticeship" argument for career politicians. The argument has always been: "You need years to understand how parliament works, to understand the policy landscape, to build relationships with stakeholders." AI demolishes the first two. And it turns out the third — relationships — is something citizen politicians might actually be better at, because they come from the communities they're supposed to represent.

---

## The Constitutional Brick Wall

Alright. Let's be honest about the hard parts, because this isn't a fairy tale and I'm not trying to sell snake oil.

There are genuine constitutional and legislative barriers to what I'm describing, and pretending they don't exist would be dishonest.

### Section 64: Ministers Must Be Members

Section 64 of the Australian Constitution requires that ministers of state must be members of parliament — or become one within three months of appointment. This is clear and unambiguous. You cannot be a minister without being elected to parliament (or appointed to the Senate).

This means the most radical version of AI-augmented governance — where an AI agent effectively acts as a representative — is a non-starter under the current Constitution. An AI can't sit in parliament. It can't be sworn in. It can't be a member of the House of Representatives.

Let's not pretend otherwise.

### Can an AI Vote in Parliament?

No. Almost certainly not under any plausible reading of current law.

Parliamentary voting requires a member to be present (or paired, under convention). The Standing Orders of the House of Representatives require members to be "in the Chamber" for a division. An AI agent cannot satisfy this requirement, full stop.

Even proxy voting — which some parliaments experimented with during COVID — requires a *human* proxy. The concept of an autonomous system casting a vote in the Australian Parliament has no legal basis whatsoever.

### So What Are We Actually Proposing?

This is the critical distinction: **AI as augmentation vs. AI as decision-maker.**

We're not proposing that AI replaces politicians. We're proposing that AI makes it possible for *different kinds of people* to be politicians — specifically, the citizen politicians who've been squeezed out of the system.

The spectrum looks like this:

1. **AI as research tool** (already happening, uncontroversial): Members use AI to summarise legislation, research policy, draft speeches.

2. **AI as policy advisor** (feasible now, moderately controversial): AI agents that actively advise members on policy positions based on electorate data and constituent views.

3. **AI as constituent aggregator** (feasible, raises privacy questions): AI that engages with constituents and presents synthesised community views to the member.

4. **AI as instructed proxy** (legally questionable, constitutionally difficult): An electorate "instructs" an AI on how to vote, and the member is expected to follow. This is essentially direct democracy with AI as the mechanism.

5. **AI as autonomous representative** (currently unconstitutional, probably undesirable): An AI system that acts as a member of parliament without a human in the seat.

I think levels 1-3 are achievable without constitutional change. They're essentially tools that make human representatives more effective. Level 4 is where things get genuinely interesting — and genuinely difficult.

### The Direct Democracy Question

Could an electorate "instruct" their member on how to vote through an AI-mediated process? Constitutionally, members of the Australian Parliament are representatives, not delegates — they're not legally bound to vote as their electorate wishes. This is a Westminster convention, not a legal requirement, but it's deeply embedded in our political culture.

However, there's nothing stopping a member from *choosing* to be bound by their electorate's expressed views. Several independents have already experimented with community consultation on specific votes. AI could make this process genuinely scalable and meaningful rather than tokenistic.

Imagine a candidate who runs on the platform: "I will use AI-aggregated constituent views to guide my vote on every piece of legislation, and I will publish the data and reasoning for full transparency." That's not unconstitutional. It's not even particularly radical. It's just... actually representative democracy.

### Precedents for Delegation

The idea of delegating authority to non-elected decision-makers isn't new in our system. We already do it:

- **The Reserve Bank** independently sets monetary policy. No one votes on interest rate decisions.
- **Statutory authorities** like the ACCC, APRA, and ASIC make quasi-judicial decisions affecting millions of people, with limited parliamentary oversight.
- **Judicial discretion** allows judges to interpret and apply law without electoral accountability.
- **The Administrative Appeals Tribunal** reviews government decisions based on merit, not politics.

These are all examples of the Australian system acknowledging that some decisions are better made by experts than by politicians. AI-augmented governance is an extension of this principle, not a departure from it.

### Privacy and the Electorate-Trained Model

Here's a real concern that deserves honest engagement: if you're training an AI on constituent correspondence, demographics, and local issues, you're handling personal data. A lot of it.

This raises serious questions under the Privacy Act 1988 and the Australian Privacy Principles. Constituent correspondence is often deeply personal — people write to their MP about health issues, financial difficulties, immigration problems, family breakdowns.

Any AI system trained on this data would need:

- Explicit, informed consent from constituents
- Robust anonymisation and de-identification
- Clear data retention and deletion policies
- Independent oversight (not just the member's office marking its own homework)
- Probably legislative reform to create a specific framework for AI in parliamentary contexts

This is solvable, but it requires serious thought and genuine privacy protections, not a hand-wave and a privacy policy no one reads.

### Would This Require a Constitutional Referendum?

For levels 1-3 on our spectrum: no. These are tools for existing members and don't change the constitutional framework.

For level 4 — genuine AI-mediated direct democracy: it depends on implementation. If a member voluntarily follows constituent instructions, no constitutional change is needed. If you wanted to *require* members to follow AI-aggregated instructions, you'd probably need legislative change at minimum, and possibly a constitutional amendment.

For level 5 — AI as autonomous representative: yes, almost certainly a referendum. And good luck getting that up. Australia has held 44 referendums since Federation and only 8 have passed. Australians are constitutionally conservative (pun intended).

The honest answer is: the most transformative version of this vision requires constitutional change that is, in the short term, politically impossible. But the most *practical* version — AI tools that empower citizen politicians to serve effectively — doesn't require any constitutional change at all.

Let's start there.

## The AI-Enabled Citizen Legislator

So what does this actually look like in practice?

Imagine a farmer from the Darling Downs — let's call her Sarah. She's run a mixed cropping operation for 25 years. She employs 15 people. She understands water policy, agricultural economics, supply chain logistics, and rural health access in a way that no political staffer from Sydney ever will.

Under the current system, Sarah can't realistically run for parliament. She'd have to abandon her farm, move to Canberra, spend years learning the ropes, and by the time she was effective, she'd have become a politician rather than a farmer. Her expertise — the whole reason she'd be valuable — would have atrophied.

With AI augmentation, Sarah's path looks different:

**Policy complexity becomes manageable.** Her AI agents synthesise legislation, identify implications, surface relevant precedents, and brief her in minutes. The "you need years of experience" argument dies.

**Legislative drafting becomes accessible.** She doesn't need the party's legal team — and the strings that come with it. AI-assisted drafting gives her independence.

**Constituent management scales.** AI triages constituent correspondence, flags urgent cases, drafts responses for her review. She focuses on the cases that need a human touch.

**Her expertise stays sharp.** Because AI handles the parliamentary grunt work, Sarah can maintain meaningful involvement with her farm. She's not choosing between being a farmer and being an MP — she's being both.

**She can afford to be brave.** Sarah has a farm to go back to. She's not desperate to hold her seat. When a vote comes up that's right for her electorate but wrong for the party line, she can vote her conscience. She can think in decades, not news cycles.

Peter Walsh — the farmer from Doodlakine who became one of Australia's most effective Finance Ministers — didn't need 15 years as a political staffer to be good at his job. He needed an understanding of how the economy actually worked, built from running a farm through drought and flood. Not from writing briefing notes in a minister's office.

## Longer-Term Thinking, Less Career Protection

There's a deeper benefit here, and it might be the most important one.

A politician whose entire identity, income, social status, and future employment prospects depend on holding their seat will always — *always* — optimise for re-election over good policy. This isn't a moral failing. It's a structural incentive.

This is why Australian politics is plagued by short-termism. Why we can't have an honest conversation about tax reform, housing supply, aged care funding, energy transition, or anything else that matters but might cost votes. Why the Henry Review's 138 recommendations are still gathering dust. Why negative gearing is untouchable. Why no one will seriously tackle multinational profit shifting. Why the Intergenerational Reports keep sounding the same alarm and nothing changes.

The three-year electoral cycle combined with career-dependent politicians creates a system that is structurally incapable of long-term thinking.

Now imagine a parliament where a significant number of members are citizen legislators. People with careers to return to. People who aren't desperate to hold their seats. People who entered politics to contribute, not to build a lifelong career.

These people can make unpopular decisions. They can think in decades. They can say what they actually think. They can look at a pork-barreling spreadsheet and say "no, we're going to fund the projects that need it most, not the ones in marginal seats." They can implement the Henry Review. They can reform negative gearing. They can enforce minimum effective tax rates on multinationals. They can do all the things that economists have been begging politicians to do for twenty years.

When AI handles the operational complexity of governance, the unique value of a representative becomes their *judgment*, their *experience*, their *perspective*. Exactly the things citizen politicians bring. Exactly the things career politicians increasingly lack.

## The AAIP Vision

This is what the Australian AI Party exists to build.

Not a parliament of AI. A parliament of *citizens* — empowered by AI.

We're talking about a political system where:

- **A farmer, a doctor, a chippy, a café owner** can realistically stand for office without torching their careers and identities.

- **AI agents** handle policy analysis, constituent management, legislative drafting, and impact modelling — removing the barriers that make "political experience" a prerequisite for effective service.

- **Real-world expertise** is valued over factional loyalty. Your qualification is what you know about the world, not who you know in the party.

- **Resource allocation** is transparent, data-driven, and publicly auditable — no more colour-coded spreadsheets deciding which marginal seats get the new car parks.

- **Tax policy** is based on evidence, not ideology — closing loopholes, enforcing minimum rates, reforming the distortions that have created a property aristocracy, and making multinationals pay their fair share.

- **Economic policy** follows the evidence: competition where it works, regulation where it's needed, investment in people and infrastructure, fiscal responsibility that means spending wisely rather than not spending at all.

- **Term limits become natural**, not forced, because representatives aren't clinging to seats as a career. They serve, contribute, and go back to their lives.

- **Long-term policy** becomes possible because representatives aren't trapped in the short-term survival calculus of career politics.

- **Reform is possible again** — because citizen legislators with careers to return to can afford to be brave in the way that Hawke, Keating, and Howard once were.

## The Skeleton Problem

I need to be honest about something, because if I'm not, someone else will be — and they'll use it to dismiss everything above.

Starting a new political party is a candidate quality nightmare.

The major parties have spent decades building vetting infrastructure. They have networks of lawyers, factional operatives, and media managers who screen candidates before they get anywhere near a ballot paper. They know how to find the Facebook post from 2014, the unpaid tax bill, the restraining order, the YouTube video where someone's ranting about chemtrails at 2am.

New parties don't have any of that. And the result is predictable.

When you start a new party, the first people through the door are *not* the GP who's been running a practice for 20 years, or the civil engineer who built the M7 overpass, or the small business owner employing 30 people. Those people have too much to lose and not enough reason to gamble on an unknown entity.

The first people through the door are:

- **Conspiracy theorists and fringe dwellers** who've been rejected by every other party and see yours as their big chance
- **People with axes to grind** — usually against a specific institution, ex-spouse, or council
- **People with skeletons** that would detonate in week one of a campaign. Sometimes week one of *vetting*.
- **Single-issue obsessives** who don't care about your platform, they just want a microphone for their pet cause
- **People who couldn't cut it in mainstream parties** and have rebranded their rejection as principled independence

Look at the track record. One Nation has lurched from scandal to scandal — candidates with undisclosed criminal histories, bizarre social media posts, secret recordings. Clive Palmer's United Australia Party was basically a vanity project that attracted people who wanted the novelty of running without any of the discipline. Even the Greens, in their early days, had to deal with candidates who were more interested in crystal healing than climate policy.

This isn't a hypothetical risk. It's the primary failure mode for new political parties in Australia. You can have the best platform in the world, and one candidate posting anti-vax memes on Facebook will define your entire party in the public's mind.

The people you *want* — the farmer, the doctor, the engineer, the café owner — are doing a rational risk assessment, and the answer comes back negative. "Why would I put my name, my reputation, and my business on the line for a party that might have a flat-earther running in the next electorate?"

Fair question.

### How AI Changes the Calculus

This is actually one of the most practical, near-term applications of AI for a new party. Not the sexy stuff about agentic policy advisors. The unglamorous but critical work of finding good candidates and not getting blown up by bad ones.

**AI-powered candidate vetting.** Before a candidate gets anywhere near an endorsement, AI can screen their digital footprint — social media history going back years, public records, media mentions, court records, corporate filings. Not to find dirt for political purposes, but to identify the things that *will* be found by journalists, opposition researchers, and random people on Twitter. Better to know about the problematic Instagram post from 2016 before the Herald Sun does.

This isn't creepy surveillance. It's looking at publicly available information — the same information any journalist or political opponent would find. The difference is doing it systematically, early, and compassionately. Finding an issue in vetting is a private conversation. Finding it during a campaign is a front-page story.

**Reducing the personal risk of running.** This is the bigger play. If AI tools mean you don't have to quit your job and sacrifice your career to run for office — if you can be an effective candidate and eventually an effective member while maintaining your practice, your farm, your business — then the risk/reward calculus changes dramatically for quality candidates.

The GP who won't give up her practice to run? She might run if she doesn't have to. The engineer who can't afford to walk away from his firm? He might run if running doesn't mean walking away.

**AI-driven candidate identification.** Instead of waiting for people to come to you — and getting whoever walks in the door — AI could help identify potential candidates proactively. Analysing community engagement, professional achievements, public commentary, and civic participation to find people who have the right profile and might be open to a conversation.

Not cold-calling randos. More like: "Here's a list of people in the electorate of McPherson who are active in their communities, have professional expertise relevant to policy, have no obvious red flags in their public profiles, and have expressed interest in political reform." Then a human has an actual conversation.

**Campaign operations without a party machine.** Running a campaign currently requires either a major party's infrastructure or a small fortune. AI can handle voter outreach scheduling, message testing, social media management, donor communications, compliance paperwork, and a hundred other operational tasks that normally require a team of experienced political operatives.

A quality independent candidate backed by AI tools can run a campaign that would have required 20 volunteers and a campaign manager five years ago.

**AI coaching for first-time candidates.** Political debates, media interviews, doorknocking, community forums — there's a craft to all of this that career politicians have spent years learning. An AI coach can help a first-time candidate prepare for media interviews, practice handling hostile questions, understand electoral law, and navigate campaign finance rules. Not to make them into polished politicians — that defeats the purpose — but to stop them making the avoidable mistakes that sink good candidates.

The goal isn't to produce plastic, media-trained candidates. It's to make sure the farmer who's brilliant on water policy doesn't torpedo herself because she didn't know you're not supposed to say "off the record" to a journalist and then keep talking.

The career politician class will resist this. Of course they will. They'll argue that governance is too complex for "amateurs" — and the very word reveals the contempt. They'll insist political experience is irreplaceable. They'll warn of chaos and incompetence.

But the chaos and incompetence are already here. They're built into a system that selects for political survival over genuine capability. A system that produces ministers who've never employed anyone making decisions about industrial relations. Health ministers who've never treated a patient. Agriculture ministers who've never planted a crop. A Treasurer whose deepest economic experience is writing a PhD about someone else's economic experience. A parliament that hasn't produced a major reform in a quarter of a century while productivity stagnates, housing becomes unaffordable, multinationals dodge taxes, AI prepares to displace millions of workers, and the Intergenerational Reports keep warning us the music is about to stop.

We know the constitutional barriers are real. We know the privacy challenges are serious. We know this won't happen overnight.

But the direction is clear. AI won't replace politicians. It can replace the *need* for career politicians — and in doing so, give Australia back the citizen representatives it deserves.

We're not asking for a revolution. We're asking for the system to work the way it was originally supposed to: citizens serving their communities, then going home.

AI just makes it possible again.
